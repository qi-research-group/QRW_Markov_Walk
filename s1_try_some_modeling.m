% well, in 
% /home/vanderj2/mnt/lyrascratch/faces_experiment/analysis/101_QC_Modeling/analysis/1_random_walk/../../history_files/*.txt
% there is a fill history of ratings and what happened during the
% experiment
% so you can check whether it's matched or mismatched
% so; 3 & 103 = too late to reply!
% 4-7 and 104-107 (practive blocks); those are \ 
% 


% 'm103_prac_stim_â€¦'

% 'm104_prac_HRAIR'    
% 'm105_prac_HRAIF'    
% 'm106_prac_HFAIF'    
% 'm107_prac_HFAIR'   

% 'm3_stim_toolate'  

% 'm4_HRAIR'   
% 'm5_HRAIF'    
% 'm6_HFAIF'
% 'm7_HFAIR'

% so 4 and 6 - match; 5 and 7 - mismatch
% 3 - no response

% we can seed/set up the QC random walk like that

% load in per sub files: ratings.txt and history.txt

% then define the model to optimize
% then define initial state, scaling strategy, cost function, etc.
